## About
Hi, I’m Leonor! I have a strong academic foundation in Management and Marketing Intelligence and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data-Driven Marketing. My passion lies in combining data analytics and strategic insights to solve real-world problems. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the fields of data science and project management as an entry-level data specialist and project leader.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex datasets and developed a knack for identifying patterns and actionable insights. I’ve also gained hands-on experience in data visualization, statistical analysis, and workflow optimization, which I believe are key assets in supporting impactful decision-making. Certifications like the IBM Data Science Specialization and Scrum Master further complement my skills.
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

In the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, I learned how to work with data from start to finish. I got a solid understanding of what data is, how to analyze it, and how it fits into a bigger ecosystem. The course taught me to think analytically—breaking down problems, asking the right questions, and using data to make decisions. I gained hands-on experience with tools like spreadsheets for organizing and calculating data, SQL for working with databases, and Tableau for creating visualizations to share insights. I also learned about cleaning messy data to make it usable and the importance of avoiding biases when collecting and analyzing information.
One of the highlights was diving into R programming, where I created visualizations and reports using R Markdown.
