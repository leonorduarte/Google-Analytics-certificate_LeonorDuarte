## About
Hi, I’m Leonor! I have a strong academic foundation in Management and Marketing Intelligence and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data-Driven Marketing. My passion lies in combining data analytics and strategic insights to solve real-world problems. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the fields of data science and project management as an entry-level data specialist and project leader.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex datasets and developed a knack for identifying patterns and actionable insights. I’ve also gained hands-on experience in data visualization, statistical analysis, and workflow optimization, which I believe are key assets in supporting impactful decision-making. Certifications like the IBM Data Science Specialization and Scrum Master further complement my skills.
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

In the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, I learned how to work with data from start to finish. I got a solid understanding of what data is, how to analyze it, and how it fits into a bigger ecosystem. The course taught me to think analytically—breaking down problems, asking the right questions, and using data to make decisions. I gained hands-on experience with tools like spreadsheets for organizing and calculating data, SQL for working with databases, and Tableau for creating visualizations to share insights. I also learned about cleaning messy data to make it usable and the importance of avoiding biases when collecting and analyzing information.
One of the highlights was diving into R programming, where I created visualizations and reports using R Markdown.

> In the Course 8: Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study, I was able to put into practice what I learned throughout the certificate. The scenario says I'm working at Cyclistic, a fictional company, and I must fulfil a business task. To do so, I will follow the six phases of the data analysis process: **ask**,**process**,**analyse**,**share**, and **act**. My analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can be leveraged to enhance Cyclistic’s marketing approach and drive the conversion of casual riders into more profitable annual members

## Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, which is a bike-share company in Chicago. Lily Moreno who is the director of marketing and also my manager, believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders (Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes) and annual members (Customers who purchase annual memberships) use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

**Stakeholders**
•	Primary: Director of Marketing, Marketing analytic team
•	Secondary: Cyclistic Executive team

## My Approach

Approach
To achieve our marketing goal of converting casual members, and ultimately profit, we asked three questions:
- HOW annual members and casual riders differ?
- WHY would casual riders buy a membership?
- HOW can digital media affect marketing tactics?

With these three questions, we set the stage going by the data analysis process roadmap (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share, and Act). we used spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, and R to address the cleaning, analysis and visual requirement at each phase of the project.
Documentation and reports were also provided to support our work and recommendations.

**Note:  Although it was advised to use only SQL, RStudio and Tableau, I decided to do also in Python for my own practice.**
